    "text": "After conducting EDA on our Diabetes Reddit comments/submissions, the next step is to conduct natural language processing (NLP) on our datasets. Here is a data analysis workflow diagram.\n\n\n\n(Workflow Diagram\n\n\nWhere we input our text data into an NLP preprocessing pipeline, the pipeline processes text data by cleaning and standardizing both comments and submissions. For submissions, it first merges the title and self-text into a unified text field, while comments are processed directly from their corresponding body content. The text then goes through a sequential cleaning process that converts it into a structured document format, breaks it down into individual words, standardizes the text by removing special characters and converting to lowercase, and finally reduces words to their root form through lemmatization. Then we employ the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) on the cleaned dataset to extract words with higher TF-IDF scores, and then use these insights to create dummy variables for sentiment modeling. The sentiment modeling involves using a pre-trained sentiment model: sentimentdl_use_twitter, and we also developed the sentiment model pipeline. Then we extract the sentiment results and create visualizations and data tables to answer our research questions in EDA."

In general, when a word has a high TF-IDF score, it means that the word appears frequently in specific documents but is relatively rare across the entire dataset, suggesting it is a distinctive and meaningful term for those particular discussions. Therefore, these words would be crucial, especially when answering the research questions. From the wordcloud, we can see that people in this subreddit mainly focus on “medication” related subjects and “lifestyle” related subjects.\nIn our dummy variables creation process, for medications, we track various drug classes including insulins, metformin, GLP-1 receptor agonists (like semaglutide), DPP-4 inhibitors, SGLT2 inhibitors, sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones, and alpha-glucosidase inhibitors. For lifestyle factors, we track diet and exercise, along with common diabetes symptoms including fatigue, thirst, blurred vision, and frequent urination. Technology-related discussions are captured through mentions of glucose monitors, insulin pumps, smartwatches, and diabetes management apps. A detailed dummy variables table is provided below.

    "text": "Sentiment Model\nAfter the dummy variable creation, we processed the transformed datasets through a pre-trained sentiment model. The model, sentimentdl_use_twitter, which is trained with social media text data, is perhaps the best-suited model for our Reddit text data. After running the model, we extracted the sentiment model results and aggregated associated datasets to answer our research questions.\n\nResearch Question 1: Comparison of Sentiments towards Medication and Lifestyle Changes\nDuring the TF-IDF process, key words such as insulin and eat emerged, demonstrating two primary categories: medication and lifestyle factors. These categories represent the most effective treatments for diabetes and align with our interest in investigating sentiment differences towards these approaches. We aggregated the sentiments for both the medication category and lifestyle factors (detailed in the dummy variables creation table). The aggregated sentiments are visualized using stacked bar charts, where blue indicates positive sentiments, yellow represents neutral sentiment, and red denotes negative sentiment.\nThe charts reveal that participants in the diabetes subreddit generally express positive attitudes towards lifestyle factors like changing diets to Keto diets, low carb, high protein diets, start workingout like walking running and lifting weights, with positive sentiments exceeding 50%. In contrast, discussions about medication show predominantly negative sentiments, with positive sentiments falling below 30%. This suggests a general preference for lifestyle modifications over medication-based treatments within the community. While this preference for lifestyle changes might be appropriate for pre-diabetes patients, it raises concerns about medication adherence among diagnosed diabetes patients. For these individuals, proper medication is crucial in preventing severe complications such as kidney failure and retinopathy, from our results, it seems that patients are trying to avoid medication at all costs.(Contributors 2024)\n\n\n\nComparison of Sentiments towards Medication and Lifestyle Changes\n\n\n\n\nResearch Question 2: Comparison of Sentiments towards Different Kinds of Medication\n\n\n\nComparison of Sentiments towards Different Kinds of Medication\n\n\nFor this research question, we examined 9 different classes of diabetes medications: Alpha inhibitors, DPP-4 inhibitors, insulin, metformin, other GLP-1 agonists, semaglutide, SGLT2 inhibitors, sulfonylureas, and TZDs. This represents a comprehensive list of modern diabetes medications, with detailed classifications provided in the table above. The stacked bar charts reveal that while people generally express negative sentiments towards medications, alpha inhibitors stand as an exception with over 60% positive sentiments on the subreddit, while semaglutide emerges as the least favored medication.\nThis finding is both interesting and counter-intuitive, as alpha inhibitors are not typically the first-line treatment for diabetes, nor do they directly influence insulin production in the body (Vijan and Hayward 2002). The notably positive sentiment toward alpha inhibitors could be attributed to two factors: potential class imbalances in the data, or their unique mechanism of action. Since alpha inhibitors don’t interact directly with insulin, patients might prefer them over first-line medications due to concerns about potential side effects, viewing alpha inhibitors as a gentler approach to glucose management. These insights could be valuable for healthcare specialists in understanding patient perspectives on medications and developing more effective educational strategies about the safety and necessity of various diabetes treatments.\n\n\nResearch Question 3: Comparison of Sentiments towards Diabetes and Related Symptoms\nFor this research question, we analyzed how Reddit users in the diabetes subreddit perceive different types of diabetes and their symptoms. We compared the four most common symptoms of diabetes: fatigue, thirst, blurred vision, and frequent urination, alongside three major diabetes categories: gestational diabetes, type 1 diabetes, and type 2 diabetes. The results reveal that users express the most negative sentiments towards blurred vision and gestational diabetes. These insights could inform approaches to improving quality of life for diabetes patients, such as developing targeted symptom-relief medications or educating the public about preventing the progression of diabetes to these more concerning symptoms.\n\n\n\nComparison of Sentiments towards Diabetes and Related Symptoms\n\n\n\n\nResearch Question 4: Overall Sentiments Trend\n\n\n\nOverall Sentiments Trend\n\n\nFor this research question, we investigated the overall sentiment trend between June 2023 and July 2024. We aggregated the sentiment results and excluded neutral sentiments, as they were minimal compared to positive and negative sentiments. From the time series plot, we observed that positive sentiments showed a sharp increase in December 2023. This interesting discovery led us to deeper investigation, where we found that researchers at Case Western Reserve University had made a groundbreaking discovery. They identified an enzyme called SNO-CoA-assisted nitrosylase that blocks insulin production in the body—a discovery that could provide a new target for diabetes treatment (University 2024). While this may not be the sole cause for this sudden increase in positive sentiment, many other factors could have contributed to this trend.\n\n\nResearch Question 5: Comparison of Sentiments towards Technologies\n\n\n\nComparison of Sentiments towards Technologies\n\n\nFor this research question, we investigated sentiments regarding four popular diabetes management technologies: mobile applications, glucose monitors, insulin pumps, and smartwatches. The results were unexpected, with smartwatches receiving the highest positive sentiment despite their limited functionality for diabetes management. More essential devices like insulin pumps and glucose monitors received notably lower positive sentiments, despite their critical role in diabetes care. These findings suggest opportunities for medical device companies to improve user experience design. Both insulin pumps and glucose monitors, while medically necessary, can be complex to use and involve procedures for blood sampling. Medical device manufacturers could focus on designing equipment that minimizes discomfort during use while maintaining clinical effectiveness."

    "text": "Diabetes is a prevalent chronic condition affecting a significant portion of the global population. In 2021, approximately 38.4 million Americans, or 11.6% of the U.S. population, had diabetes, with 29.7 million diagnosed and 8.7 million undiagnosed. The prevalence is notably higher among seniors, with 29.2% of Americans aged 65 and older affected.(Disease Control and Prevention 2023) Globally, the number of adults diagnosed with diabetes has more than quadrupled since 1990, reaching over 800 million in 2022.(MarketWatch 2024) This alarming increase is attributed to factors such as rising obesity rates, unhealthy diets, physical inactivity, and economic challenges. The surge in diabetes cases underscores the urgent need for effective prevention and management strategies worldwide."
