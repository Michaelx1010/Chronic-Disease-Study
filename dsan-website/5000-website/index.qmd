### Brief intro

-   Hello , my name is Xinzhe Xie, I prefer to go by Michael. I come from Chongqing, China. I graduated from the University of Massachusetts Amherst in 2021 as a Statistics and Actuary major, after I graduated, I worked in China as a data analyst, working on developing river water quality forecast models. My work primarily focuses on using mechanical modeling methods using R, building interactive data visualization using R shiny, deploying applications using shiny proxy and docker, neural networking, and SARIMA time series were also implemented. I'm interested in machine learning and time series modeling, I would love to become a data scientist after graduating from the program, especially in environmental and healthcare fields. As for hobbies, I'm really passionate about weightlifting, specially weighted calisthenics and power lifting. I'm also a swimming athlete growing up.Â 

-   I'm really passionate about time series and machine learning, since I had lots of experience with time series during my work before coming to Georgetown where I had to deal with large times series data sets, applying different models to the data to better understand the trend, and that is the reason why I signed up for DSAN 5600 this semester. Also, I'm passionate with machine learning, especially deep learning method including neutral network modeling, also those methods can be applied to time series which definitely improves the overall accuracy of modelling.

### Professional interest

-   Advanced R, python programming

-   Time series forecast modeling, including ARIMA, SARIMA, Bayesian structural time series ,etc

-   Deep learning method such as Neural networking for forecasting in different areas including Stocks, Healthcare, Weather, etc

-   Software developing including applications building and deployment.

### Education

-   2021: BS in Mathematics, University of Massachusetts Amherst
