    "text": "Environmental/lifestyle factors in the pathogenesis and prevention of type 2 diabetes\n\nThis article talks about different factors related to the causes and prevention of type 2 diabetes (T2D) based on epidemiological studies and intervention trials. This article dives deeply in different aspects of lifestyle factors including dietary habits, sleeping disorders, mental affects, body fat mass, etc. This topic is crucial for investigating potential lifestyle risk factors to develop T2D, that could not only improve public awareness but also give data collecting/analysis hypothesis for biostatistician.\nThis article also address current data on personal, environmental, and lifestyle aspects are often limited. A host of environmental or lifestyle-dependent T2D risk factors have been described in prospective epidemiological studies, ranging from energy-dense food consumption to long-term exposure to high levels of fine dust. In these studies, the amount of personal, environmental or lifestyle aspects data that can or has been documented is limited, leaving room for confounding. Kolb and Martin (2017)\nThis article will give me the initial hypothesis of possible factors that contribute do the developmnent of T2D. I will be able explore relevant datasets according to those hypothesis.\n\n\n\nCancer Prevention: From 1727 to Milestones of the Past 100 Years\n\nThis article Lippman and Hawk (2009) talks about the rich history of the efforts on cancer prevention from from 1727 to milestones of the past 100 years, it disucsses the importance of historical research of cancer prevention and how it provides foundations for modern method including Molecular-Targeted Combinations, Population-Wide Approaches, Angiogenesis Targeting, New Imaging Approaches.\nCancer is obviously a huge challenge that affects millions of lives in this world. In order to better understand the cancer and its prevention methods, we can facilitate early detection that leads to more effective treatments. The information in ths article provide me with a better understanding of cancer and its historical prevention methods, gives me insight on hypothesis testing.\n\n\n\nQuestions to answer:\n\nWhat are the risk factors(including lifestyles, diets, enviromental factors, genetics, etc) that contributes to T2D? In other words, what factors have strong statitical correlation with the incidence of T2D.\nWhat risk factors have less correlation with T2D?\nAmong the risk factors that have strong correlation with T2D, which one has the highest correlation?\nAmong the risk factors that have less correlation with T2D, which one has the least correlation?\nWhat types of predictive has the best estimate an individual’s risk of developing T2D?\nAre there early signs that can be detected through regression analysis, allowing for the early diagnosis of T2D?\nCan we develop accurate predictive models for blood glucose levels in T2D patients to help with insulin dosage and meal planning?\nCan we use machine learning or time-series models to detect early signs of cancer?\nWhat are the risk factors associated with specific types of cancer? How do genetic, lifestyle, environmental, and demographic factors contribute to cancer development?\nHow can data visualization effectively communicate information of chronic diseases.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nKolb, Hubert, and Stephan Martin. 2017. “Environmental/Lifestyle Factors in the Pathogenesis and Prevention of Type 2 Diabetes.” BMC Med 15 (1): 131. https://doi.org/10.1186/s12916-017-0901-x.\n\n\nLippman, Scott M, and Ernest T Hawk. 2009. “Cancer Prevention: From 1727 to Milestones of the Past 100 Years.” Cancer Research 69 (13): 5269–84. https://doi.org/10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-09-1750."

    "text": "Brief intro\n\nHello , my name is Xinzhe Xie, I prefer to go by Michael. I come from Chongqing, China. I graduated from the University of Massachusetts Amherst in 2021 as a Statistics and Actuary major, after I graduated, I worked in China as a data analyst, working on developing river water quality forecast models. My work primarily focuses on using mechanical modeling methods using R, building interactive data visualization using R shiny, deploying applications using shiny proxy and docker, neural networking, and SARIMA time series were also implemented. I’m interested in machine learning and time series modeling, I would love to become a data scientist after graduating from the program, especially in environmental and healthcare fields. As for hobbies, I’m really passionate about weightlifting, specially weighted calisthenics and power lifting. I’m also a swimming athlete growing up. \nI’m really passionate about time series and machine learning, since I had lots of experience with time series during my work before coming to Georgetown where I had to deal with large times series data sets, applying different models to the data to better understand the trend, and that is the reason why I signed up for DSAN 5600 this semester. Also, I’m passionate with machine learning, especially deep learning method including neutral network modeling, also those methods can be applied to time series which definitely improves the overall accuracy of modelling.\n\n\n\nProfessional interest\n\nAdvanced R, python programming\nTime series forecast modeling, including ARIMA, SARIMA, Bayesian structural time series ,etc\nDeep learning method such as Neural networking for forecasting in different areas including Stocks, Healthcare, Weather, etc\nSoftware developing including applications building and deployment.\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n2021: BS in Mathematics, University of Massachusetts Amherst"
