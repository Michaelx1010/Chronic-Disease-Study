I graduated from the University of Massachusetts Amherst in 2021 as a Statistics and Actuary major, after I graduated, I worked in China as a data analyst, working on developing river water quality forecast models. My work primarily focuses on using mechanical modeling methods using R, building interactive data visualization using R shiny, deploying applications using shiny proxy and docker, neural networking, and SARIMA time series were also implemented. I’m interested in machine learning and time series modeling, I would love to become a data scientist after graduating from the program, especially in environmental and healthcare fields. As for hobbies, I’m really passionate about weightlifting, specially weighted calisthenics and power lifting. I’m also a swimming athlete growing up. \nI’m really passionate about time series and machine learning, since I had lots of experience with time series during my work before coming to Georgetown where I had to deal with large times series data sets, applying different models to the data to better understand the trend, and that is the reason why I signed up for DSAN 5600 this semester. Also, I’m passionate with machine learning, especially deep learning method including neutral network modeling, also those methods can be applied to time series which definitely improves the overall accuracy of modelling.\n\n\n\nProfessional interest\n\nAdvanced R, python programming\nTime series forecast modeling, including ARIMA, SARIMA, Bayesian structural time series ,etc\nDeep learning method such as Neural networking for forecasting in different areas including Stocks, Healthcare, Weather, etc\nSoftware developing including applications building and deployment.\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n2021: BS in Mathematics, University of Massachusetts Amherst"

    "text": "Environmental/lifestyle factors in the pathogenesis and prevention of type 2 diabetes\n\nThis article talks about different factors related to the causes and prevention of type 2 diabetes (T2D) based on epidemiological studies and intervention trials. This article dives deeply in different aspects of lifestyle factors including dietary habits, sleeping disorders, mental affects, body fat mass, etc. This topic is crucial for investigating potential lifestyle risk factors to develop T2D, that could not only improve public awareness but also give data collecting/analysis hypothesis for biostatistician.\nThis article also address current data on personal, environmental, and lifestyle aspects are often limited. A host of environmental or lifestyle-dependent T2D risk factors have been described in prospective epidemiological studies, ranging from energy-dense food consumption to long-term exposure to high levels of fine dust. In these studies, the amount of personal, environmental or lifestyle aspects data that can or has been documented is limited, leaving room for confounding. Kolb and Martin (2017)\nThis article will give me the initial hypothesis of possible factors that contribute do the developmnent of T2D. I will be able explore relevant datasets according to those hypothesis.\n\n\n\nCancer Prevention: From 1727 to Milestones of the Past 100 Years\n\nThis article Lippman and Hawk (2009) talks about the rich history of the efforts on cancer prevention from from 1727 to milestones of the past 100 years, it disucsses the importance of historical research of cancer prevention and how it provides foundations for modern method including Molecular-Targeted Combinations, Population-Wide Approaches, Angiogenesis Targeting, New Imaging Approaches.\nCancer is obviously a huge challenge that affects millions of lives in this world. In order to better understand the cancer and its prevention methods, we can facilitate early detection that leads to more effective treatments. The information in ths article provide me with a better understanding of cancer and its historical prevention methods, gives me insight on hypothesis testing.\n\n\n\nQuestions to answer:\n\nWhat are the risk factors(including lifestyles, diets, enviromental factors, genetics, etc) that contributes to T2D? In other words, what factors have strong statitical correlation with the incidence of T2D.\nWhat risk factors have less correlation with T2D?\nAmong the risk factors that have strong correlation with T2D, which one has the highest correlation?\nAmong the risk factors that have less correlation with T2D, which one has the least correlation?\nWhat types of predictive has the best estimate an individual’s risk of developing T2D?\nAre there early signs that can be detected through regression analysis, allowing for the early diagnosis of T2D?\nCan we develop accurate predictive models for blood glucose levels in T2D patients to help with insulin dosage and meal planning?\nCan we use machine learning or time-series models to detect early signs of cancer?\nWhat are the risk factors associated with specific types of cancer? How do genetic, lifestyle, environmental, and demographic factors contribute to cancer development?\nHow can data visualization effectively communicate information of chronic diseases.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nKolb, Hubert, and Stephan Martin. 2017. “Environmental/Lifestyle Factors in the Pathogenesis and Prevention of Type 2 Diabetes.” BMC Med 15 (1): 131. https://doi.org/10.1186/s12916-017-0901-x.\n\n\nLippman, Scott M, and Ernest T Hawk. 2009. “Cancer Prevention: From 1727 to Milestones of the Past 100 Years.” Cancer Research 69 (13): 5269–84. https://doi.org/10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-09-1750."

to present)\n2011-2019. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). State Tobacco Activities Tracking and Evaluation (STATE) System. BRFSS Survey Data. The BRFSS is a continuous, state-based surveillance system that collects information about modifiable risk factors for chronic diseases and other leading causes of death. The data for the STATE System were extracted from the annual BRFSS surveys from participating states. Tobacco topics included are cigarette and e-cigarette use prevalence by demographics, cigarette and e-cigarette use frequency, and quit attempts.

The Framingham Heart Study was a landmark study in epidemiology in that it was the first prospective study of cardiovascular disease and identified the concept of risk factors and their joint effects. The study began in 1948 and 5,209 subjects were initially enrolled in the study. Participants have been examined biennially since the inception of the study and all subjects are continuously followed through regular surveillance for cardiovascular outcomes. Clinic examination data has included cardiovascular disease risk factors and markers of disease such as blood pressure, blood chemistry, lung function, smoking history, health behaviors, ECG tracings, Echocardiography, and medication use. Through regular surveillance of area hospitals, participant contact, and death certificates, the Framingham Heart Study reviews and adjudicates events for the occurrence of Angina Pectoris, Myocardial Infarction, Heart Failure, and Cerebrovascular disease.\n\n\nCode\nheart_study &lt;- read_csv(\"data/frmgham2.csv\")\nhead(heart_study)\n\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 39\n  RANDID   SEX TOTCHOL   AGE SYSBP DIABP CURSMOKE CIGPDAY   BMI DIABETES BPMEDS\n   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;\n1   2448     1     195    39  106   70          0       0  27.0        0      0\n2   2448     1     209    52  121   66          0       0  NA          0      0\n3   6238     2     250    46  121   81          0       0  28.7        0      0\n4   6238     2     260    52  105   69.5        0       0  29.4        0      0\n5   6238     2     237    58  108   66          0       0  28.5        0      0\n6   9428     1     245    48  128.  80          1      20  25.3        0      0\n# ℹ 28 more variables: HEARTRTE &lt;dbl&gt;, GLUCOSE &lt;dbl&gt;, educ &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   PREVCHD &lt;dbl&gt;, PREVAP &lt;dbl&gt;, PREVMI &lt;dbl&gt;, PREVSTRK &lt;dbl&gt;, PREVHYP &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   TIME &lt;dbl&gt;, PERIOD &lt;dbl&gt;, HDLC &lt;dbl&gt;, LDLC &lt;dbl&gt;, DEATH &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   ANGINA &lt;dbl&gt;, HOSPMI &lt;dbl&gt;, MI_FCHD &lt;dbl&gt;, ANYCHD &lt;dbl&gt;, STROKE &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   CVD &lt;dbl&gt;, HYPERTEN &lt;dbl&gt;, TIMEAP &lt;dbl&gt;, TIMEMI &lt;dbl&gt;, TIMEMIFC &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   TIMECHD &lt;dbl&gt;, TIMESTRK &lt;dbl&gt;, TIMECVD &lt;dbl&gt;, TIMEDTH &lt;dbl&gt;, TIMEHYP &lt;dbl&gt;"

    "text": "Introduction to Naïve Bayes\n\nNaive Bayes classification, grounded in Bayes’ theorem, is a supervised machine learning algorithm designed to categorize items into pre-established labels, it is famous for its proficiency in text-analysis.\nThe Naive Bayes classification use the Bayes theorem as foundation, the Bayes theorem is given by the conditional probability of some hypothesis given some evidence, the function of the Bayes theorem is given by : \\(P(A|B) = \\frac{P(B|A) \\cdot P(A)}{P(B)}\\).\nAccording to the name “Naive Bayes Classier”, the object of the supervised machine learning method is having the ability to classify or predict object’s label based on the given labels. The algorithm aims to calculate the probability of each class given a set of input features and then assigns the class with the highest probability as the predicted class for the input.\n\n\n\nThe Gaussian Naive Bayes is used when assume our label/feature data has a normal distribution, it is best suitable for continuous data with a normal distribution.\nThe multinational Naive Bayes is implemented if the data has a discrete variable, it is best suitable for text classification.\nBernoulli Naive Bayes is used on binary data, it is best suitable for document classification where it is either present or absence.\n\n\n\nData preparation for Naïve Bayes\n\nLoad the cleaned data of the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset\n\n\n\nCode\n# Load required libraries and implement the cleaned data\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(plotly)\nlibrary(ggthemes)\nlibrary(DT)\nlibrary(e1071)\nlibrary(caTools)\nlibrary(caret)\nlibrary(mlbench)\nlibrary(cvms)\n\n#us_chronic &lt;- read_csv(\"data/us_chronic.csv\")\n\ndata(PimaIndiansDiabetes)\ndata &lt;- PimaIndiansDiabetes\n\n\n\nSplit the data into train set, test set and validation set\n\n\n\nCode\n# Setting the ratio\nfractionTraining   &lt;- 0.60\nfractionValidation &lt;- 0.20\nfractionTest       &lt;- 0.20\n\n# Compute sample sizes.\nsampleSizeTraining   &lt;- floor(fractionTraining   * nrow(data))\nsampleSizeValidation &lt;- floor(fractionValidation * nrow(data))\nsampleSizeTest       &lt;- floor(fractionTest       * nrow(data))\n\n# Create the randomly-sampled indices for the dataframe.

Through the division of the dataset into distinct sets, this process allows for an evaluation of the model’s capability to generalize effectively to real-world data instances that were not part of its training or validation phases.\n\n\nFeature selection for record data with repsect to Diabetes\n(The following code was modified from (https://machinelearningmastery.com/feature-selection-with-the-caret-r-package/)), This website gives me a good insight into using R for feature selection.\n\n\nCode\n# calculate correlation matrix\ncorrelationMatrix &lt;- cor(data_training[,1:8])\n# summarize the correlation matrix\nprint(correlationMatrix)\n\n\n             pregnant   glucose   pressure     triceps     insulin         mass\npregnant  1.000000000 0.1301659 0.06473538 -0.07743538 -0.08314813  0.004970805\nglucose   0.130165876 1.0000000 0.19177155  0.10382281  0.36614865  0.223254422\npressure  0.064735382 0.1917715 1.00000000  0.19689978  0.11607410  0.290971405\ntriceps  -0.077435382 0.1038228 0.19689978  1.00000000  0.45070904  0.434417513\ninsulin  -0.083148128 0.3661487 0.11607410  0.45070904  1.00000000  0.228454299\nmass      0.004970805 0.2232544 0.29097140  0.43441751  0.22845430  1.000000000\npedigree -0.068834359 0.1336720 0.03278284  0.20802048  0.12417427  0.139319213\nage       0.526983573 0.2782001 0.19379850 -0.13123829 -0.03563741 -0.012374778\n            pedigree         age\npregnant -0.06883436  0.52698357\nglucose   0.13367205  0.27820014\npressure  0.03278284  0.19379850\ntriceps   0.20802048 -0.13123829\ninsulin   0.12417427 -0.03563741\nmass      0.13931921 -0.01237478\npedigree  1.00000000  0.01570052\nage       0.01570052  1.00000000\n\n\nCode\n# find attributes that are highly corrected (ideally &gt;0.75)\nhighlyCorrelated &lt;- findCorrelation(correlationMatrix, cutoff=0.5)\n# print indexes of highly correlated attributes\nprint(highlyCorrelated)\n\n\n[1] 1\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# prepare training scheme\ncontrol &lt;- trainControl(method=\"repeatedcv\", number=10, repeats=3)\n# train the model\nmodel &lt;- train(diabetes~., data=data_training, method=\"lvq\", preProcess=\"scale\", trControl=control)\n# estimate variable importance\nimportance &lt;- varImp(model, scale=FALSE)\n# summarize importance\nprint(importance)\n\n\nROC curve variable importance\n\n         Importance\nglucose      0.7885\nmass         0.7084\nage          0.6957\npregnant     0.6191\npedigree     0.6074\npressure     0.5995\ntriceps      0.5924\ninsulin      0.5543\n\n\nCode\n# plot importance\nplot(importance)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# define the control using a random forest selection function\ncontrol &lt;- rfeControl(functions=rfFuncs, method=\"cv\", number=10)\n# run the RFE algorithm\nresults &lt;- rfe(data_training[,1:8], data_training[,9], sizes=c(1:8), rfeControl=control)\n# summarize the results\nprint(results)\n\n\n\nRecursive feature selection\n\nOuter resampling method: Cross-Validated (10 fold) \n\nResampling performance over subset size:\n\n Variables Accuracy  Kappa AccuracySD KappaSD Selected\n         1   0.6674 0.2098    0.07322  0.1729         \n         2   0.7500 0.4281    0.06255  0.1447         \n         3   0.7370 0.4095    0.09134  0.2051         \n         4   0.7522 0.4421    0.05041  0.1138         \n         5   0.7630 0.4626    0.05466  0.1216        *\n         6   0.7522 0.4405    0.05538  0.1266         \n         7   0.7457 0.4267    0.06321  0.1412         \n         8   0.7543 0.4407    0.05523  0.1254         \n\nThe top 5 variables (out of 5):\n   glucose, mass, age, pregnant, pedigree\n\n\nCode\n# list the chosen features\npredictors(results)\n\n\n[1] \"glucose\"  \"mass\"     \"age\"      \"pregnant\" \"pedigree\"\n\n\nCode\n# plot the results\nplot(results, type=c(\"g\", \"o\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNaïve Bayes (NB) with Labeled Record Data\n\nModel fitting\n\n\n\nCode\nnb &lt;- data_training %&gt;%\n  select(diabetes, glucose, age, mass, pregnant, insulin, pedigree, triceps, pressure)\nglimpse(nb)\n\n\nRows: 460\nColumns: 9\n$ diabetes &lt;fct&gt;

Subsequently, I will recycle the established code for use in other investigative analyses.\n\n\nCode\n# Histogram\nggplot(e1_filled, aes(x = Diabetes)) +\n  geom_histogram() +\n  labs(title = \"Histogram of Diabetes data\", x = \"Diabetes\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Boxplot\nggplot(e1_filled, aes(y = Diabetes)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  labs(title = \"Boxplot of Data\", y = \"Diabetes\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Q-Q plot\nqqnorm(e1_filled$Diabetes)\nqqline(e1_filled$Diabetes, col = \"red\")\n\n\n\n\n\nThe visualizations reveal that the distribution of our data closely approximates a normal distribution. The histogram highlights a concentration of values around the mean, with a noticeable tail extending beyond a value of 15. Additionally, the boxplot illustrates the majority of the data clustering within the interquartile range, while a few outliers are observed towards the upper end of the distribution. These findings suggest a generally normal distribution with a presence of notable outliers at higher values.\n\n\nEDA Reports\n(All the tabular reports could be accessed through Data Understanding and Descriptive Statistics.)\nThe dataset under examination is a comprehensive repository encompassing chronic disease data across U.S. territories from 2001 to 2021. Comprising 1,185,676 observations and 26 variables, each entry corresponds to a specific U.S. state in a given year. The dataset encompasses 17 major categories, spanning cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, cancer, nutritional information, kidney disease, mental health, and more. Further granularity is provided by 19 distinct data types, including crude rates, age-adjusted crude rates, means, and various other metrics.\nThis expansive dataset poses a significant challenge due to its scale and complexity. Through exploratory data analysis (EDA), the intricacies of these diverse categories and subcategories have been elucidated. EDA has been instrumental in unraveling the nuances of prevalence rates, mortality figures, and population statistics for tobacco users, among others. The EDA process involved thorough examination of data distributions and utilization of ggplot for in-depth visualizations, facilitating a comprehensive understanding of underlying correlations.\nArmed with these insights, the groundwork has been laid for a more detailed and nuanced data analysis. The multifaceted nature of the dataset, coupled with the systematic approach taken thus far, positions the research to delve into intricate patterns and relationships, paving the way for a robust and comprehensive machine learning modeling.\n\n\nTools and softwares\nFor the core of this project, I will leverage R and the powerful tools provided by the tidyverse, specifically utilizing ggplot2 for creating insightful visualizations. Additionally, to enhance the depth and breadth of the project, I plan to incorporate Python into the analysis. Python libraries such as Seaborn,Plotly and Scikit-learn will be employed to further enrich the project’s dimensions and offer diverse perspectives through their advanced plotting capabilities and machine learning model constructing. This multi-language approach aims to harness the strengths of both R and Python, ensuring a comprehensive and robust analysis."
